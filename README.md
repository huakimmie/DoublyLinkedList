# DoublyLinkedList
This C++ implementation follows the principles of RAII, resource acquisition is initialization, completely abstracting and encapsulating its use of heap memory. It is created along with a true iterator class, that is one that never utilizes deep copying and carries all functionalities of a traditional iterator. The list itself is doubly linked, allowing for traversing in both directions as well as standard functions such as size and insert.
